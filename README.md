Java + Selenium Automation Project
Project Overview
This project is an automation framework built using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and a Hybrid Framework. It automates various functionalities of a web application and integrates with Jenkins for continuous integration. The project was created as part of a crash course on Java and Selenium to enhance my skills in automation testing.

Key Features
Hybrid Automation Framework: Combines Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, and Page Object Model (POM) approaches for flexible and maintainable test scripts.
Java + Selenium: Automates browser actions, form submissions, navigation, and validations across multiple browsers.
TestNG: Used for managing test cases, generating test reports, and parallel execution.
Git + GitHub Integration: The project is version-controlled using Git, and hosted on GitHub.
Jenkins Integration: The project is set up to run automatically using Jenkins, providing a continuous integration solution.
Cross-browser Testing: Supports automated testing on different browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
Technologies Used
Java: Programming language for writing test scripts.
Selenium WebDriver: Automation tool for web applications.
TestNG: Testing framework for managing test cases and generating reports.
Hybrid Framework: A combination of different automation approaches.
Git & GitHub: Version control and code repository.
Jenkins: Continuous integration tool for automating test execution.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8+).
Eclipse IDE or any other Java-supported IDE.
Maven for dependency management.
Git for version control.
Selenium WebDriver dependencies.
TestNG testing framework.
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Mohd-Ashif0770/your-project-repo.git
Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
Install required dependencies using Maven:
bash
Copy code
mvn install
Configure your TestNG.xml file for executing test cases.
To run tests locally, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
mvn test
Running Tests on Jenkins
Make sure Jenkins is installed and configured on your machine.
Create a new Jenkins job and link it to this GitHub repository.
In Jenkins, configure the GitHub project URL and schedule periodic builds.
Execute the project from Jenkins and view the reports in the TestNG or Jenkins Dashboard.
